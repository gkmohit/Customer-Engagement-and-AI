Hey,
How are you doing?
I want you to build a single html file with local storage.
Here is the flow:
Dashboard -> Task manager
Dashboard -> Budget Tracking
Dashbaord -> Note taking

I want to add the option to switch between dark theme and light theme,
plus add some gamifications. I want to build graphs based on the data a user adds.

The graphs, themes, and gamification aspects should show up on the dashboard.
Please use the colours from the png uploaded.

Make the app tile based and focused for Gen-z users.

The task mamanger should be a scrum board that can track projects, deadlines, categories.
I want you to track completed tasks and show it on the dashboard graph. I should be able to
add recurring tasks, task templates (school, business, work, personal, family, baby) plus I
want you to recommend task priorities based on due dates and past completion patterns.

Budget Tracker should include income, expenses, savings goals, and visualizations of spending habits.
It should allow users to set budgets for different categories and track their progress. Create a spending
recommendation feature that suggests budget adjustments based on spending patterns.

Note taking should allow users to create, edit, and delete notes.
It should support rich text formatting and tagging for easy organization.
The dashboard should display a summary of tasks, budget status, and recent notes.

Make sure the app uses theme from www.text.ai and the tiles should open task manager, budget, and notes modules. 
The whole app should be responsive and work well on mobile devices. and I should be able to link each item from the above three
to each other, i.e link task manager with notes, budget tracker with tasks, etc.
Please use modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript practices.
