# Task Manager Web Application

## Overview
The Task Manager is a simple web application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. It allows users to create tasks with due dates, assign flexible task types, set priority levels, and provides features for filtering and sorting tasks. The application also stores tasks in the browser's localStorage, ensuring that your tasks persist even after refreshing the page.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Users can create new tasks with a title, due date, type, and priority level.
- **Task Types**: Users can categorize tasks into different types (e.g., Work, Personal, Study).
- **Priority Levels**: Tasks can be assigned priority levels (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
- **Filtering**: Users can filter tasks based on type and priority.
- **Sorting**: Tasks can be sorted by due date or priority.
- **Local Storage**: All tasks are saved in localStorage, allowing for persistence across sessions.

## Usage Instructions
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Use the input fields to add a new task, specifying the title, due date, type, and priority.
3. Click the "Add Task" button to save the task.
4. Use the filtering options to view specific tasks based on type or priority.
5. Sort tasks by clicking on the respective sorting options.
6. Tasks will be saved automatically in localStorage, so you can refresh the page without losing your data.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that your browser supports localStorage for the application to function correctly.
- The application is designed to be responsive and should work on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Future Improvements
- Implement user authentication to save tasks across different devices.
- Add a feature to edit or delete existing tasks.
- Enhance the user interface with more styling and animations.
